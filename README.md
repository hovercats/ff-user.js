## Firefox user.js profiles
In this repo, youll find two user.js profiles, each have their own usecases.
I rearly if ever use the PTIO one, but its convinient to have one that I know work everywwhere, while yet being more secure/private than default configs.
This repo was initially created with the intention of making it convinient for me, if I were to loose my conifgs, but I figured, why not make it so others can enjoy it aswell.

### PTIO-user.js
This user.js, is the profile Ive used for a long time, and its proven to work.
Its based off of the recommendations of (Privacytools.io's about:config)[https://privacytools.io/browsers/#about_config].
The goal of this profile, is as following;
	- Just work.
	- Convinient, yet more secure/private than default configs
	- Should work fine for the everyday man, looking for more privacy without comprimising on usablity
	- Minimal breakage on sites (I personally dont care too much about some breakage, as far as sites functionallity is still retained

### Arkenfox-based
In this user.js, I will focus on having hardening to a maximun, while yet be able to actually use it for my day to day stuff.
I would still like to be able to log into i.e. reddit, without having to switch profiles just to do so.
The ptio-based, is in reality (to me) a backup if I dont really find the time to figure out what the culprit of breakage on X website, instead just switch profile and do my business, and be on my mary way. 
I will try my best to keep some track of Arkenfox's work, and add/remove stuff as theyre added/removed/depreciated.

Feel free to use these as you wish, or create an issue if theres any problems that needs to be solved.
