# user.js
This repo contains my personal user.js profiles, which is based off of Arkenfox user.js [https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js], and Privacytools.io (https://privacytools.io/browsers/#about_config].
I created this repo, mainly to make it convinient for me easily get my configs straight after reinstalling an OS or firefox, which tbh, is a tedious process, atleast with Arkenfox-based part.

# Privacytools.io-based
I made this user.js, due to some sites will simpy just not work with a really hardened setup, as its with Tor browser on safest option. 
Goals of this user.js is as following:
- Keep breakage to a minimum from about:config configurations
- Have a hardened, yet usable profile, for sites prone to breakage, or youd just rather not deal with a really hardened ff setup
A note on this; I WILL, over time add some configs to deal with some annoying/useless stuff, like the recommendation in the addon page and so on.

# Arkenfox-based
In this user.js, I will focus on having hardening to a maximun, while yet be able to actually use it for my day to day stuff.
I would still like to be able to log into i.e. reddit, without having to switch profiles just to do so.
The ptio-based, is in reality (to me) a backup if I dont really find the time to figure out what the culprit of breakage on X website, instead just switch profile and do my business, and be on my mary way. 
I will try my best to keep some track of Arkenfox's work, and add/remove stuff as theyre added/removed/depreciated.

Feel free to use these as you wish, or create an issue if theres any problems that needs to be solved.
