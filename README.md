## Firefox user.js profiles
In this repo, youll find two user.js profiles, each have their own usecases.
I rearly if ever use the PTIO one, but its convinient to have one that I know work everywwhere, while yet being more secure/private than default configs.
This repo was initially created with the intention of making it convinient for me, if I were to loose my conifgs, but I figured, why not make it so others can enjoy it aswell.


### PTIO-user.js
This user.js, is the profile Ive used for a long time, and its proven to work.
Its based off of the recommendations of [Privacytools.io's about:config](https://privacytools.io/browsers/#about_config).
The goal of this profile, is as following;

- Just work.
- Convinient, yet more secure/private than default configs
- Should work fine for the everyday man, looking for more privacy without comprimising on usablity
- Minimal breakage on sites (I personally dont care too much about some breakage, as far as sites functionallity is still retained
What currently works;
[x] Everything


### Arkenfox-based
In this user.js, Ive used [Arkenfox's templated](github.com/arkenfox/user.js), and just commented/uncommented some stuff to my liking.
Ive focused on hardening, but Ive tried not to obliterate usablity to an unsuable state. 
I plan on using this as my main profile, so being able to do everyday stuff like i.e. reddit or use ~~youtube~~ *coff*, **invidious** should be expected to work. 
Some breakage is to be expected.
What currently works;

[ ] Reddit

* There seems to be an issue with the logging in part, Im able to log in, but the screen wont load after this
[x] ~~YouTube~~ **Invidious**

* I havent tested YT's site, nor yt player on invidious, as I dont personally use it, but it is expected to break due to some settings.
* You should not use YT anyway, stick with Invidious

I will try my best to keep some track of Arkenfox's work, and add/remove stuff as theyre added/removed/depreciated.

Feel free to use these as you wish, or create an issue if theres any problems that needs to be solved.
